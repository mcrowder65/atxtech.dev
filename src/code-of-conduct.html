    <h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
    <div class="code-of-conduct">
      <p>
        The ATXTech Slack Community exists to provide a space for individuals
        (humans) who live in the greater Austin region to communicate, interact,
        share interesting ideas, and support each other in achieving their
        goals. While we welcome some participation in conversations from folks
        outside of the region, this Slack is not a platform to solicit
        individuals for products or services, especially those that benefit
        people outside of the greater Austin region. All accounts on this Slack
        must be for individual humans. Offering products or services through
        direct messages is forbidden.
      </p>

      <p>
        We hope to create an environment in which all individuals can
        participate in a positive and affirming way. Behavior that contributes
        to this sort of environment includes using welcoming and inclusive
        language, being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences,
        gracefully accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best
        for the community at large, and showing empathy towards other community
        members.
      </p>

      <p>
        The ATXTech Slack Community is committed to providing an experience that
        is safe and free from harassment or offense for everyone, regardless of
        personal attributes such as gender, gender identity and expression,
        sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or
        religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. We
        expect members to act in good faith to avoid intentionally offending
        others.
      </p>

      <p>
        This code of conduct applies to all public and private channels as well
        as direct messages. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be
        sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the
        admins.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are being harassed or offended by a member of the community,
        notice that someone else is being harassed or offended, or have any
        other concerns, please contact Matt Crowder by direct message, @matt. I
        will respond as promptly as I can.
